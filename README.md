# Tabletop Auction House - React Edition

## Description

Do you love reading? 

This fully functioning Google Books API search engine will help you find new books and save them to your profile. Once you've read or no longer are interested in the books on your profile, you can delete them via your saved books page.

The Google Books API search engine was originally built with a RESTful API and was refactored to run on GraphQL API with Apollo Server. The application was built using the MERN stack with a React front-end, a MongoDB database, and a Node.js/Express.js server and API.

Finding new books has never been easier!
